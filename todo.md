## Details

### 13. Accept a verification code pasted with surrounding whitespace.

A pasted code fails the browser's `pattern` check. No zero-JS fix exists: `pattern`
cannot transform, so loosening it only lets the untrimmed value through to Kratos. **Check first:**
`kratos-admin.ts` returns a `recovery_link` alongside the code; if the stock courier mail can carry
one, a template change fixes this with no host code. Otherwise proxy the flow POST through the host:
`submitFlow` (`src/auth/kratos-public.ts`) already relays cookies and normalises a 422
`redirect_browser_to`, and has no callers outside tests. CSRF improves, since the POST becomes
same-origin and `form-action 'self'` can join the CSP. Risks: one `flow.ui.action` serves all five
flows, so this rewrites the sign-in path; and Go's nosurf checks Referer only over https, which no
test covers. Code entry has no E2E coverage today.

### 19. Run the documented Docker commands on macOS and fix whatever misbehaves.

Needs a Mac. Two suspects, both from `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`: a macOS `id -g` is `20`, which is
`dialout` inside the noble image, and Docker Desktop remaps bind-mount ownership in its VM.

### 16. Decide whether the single Keto `Resource` namespace splits into per-domain namespaces.

Ory's own examples model `Shift`, `Document` and so on. One global `Resource` bucket is the
project's "no catch-all names" rule applied to namespaces.

### 6. Warn at discovery when a route or nav node gates on a permission no plugin declares.

Declaring stays optional on purpose, but the picker is built from declarations only, so such a route
is ungrantable from the GUI and answers a permanent 403. A warning, not an error.

### 23. Give list pages one view-model helper from query to pagination, instead of ~40 hand-written lines each.

Every list screen bridges `parseListQuery`/`paginate` to the partials by hand. At minimum a
`buildPaginationModel(page, hrefFor)`. Exported through the barrel, so it is contract surface.

### 43. Let a plugin version the scripts and other `/public/` files its own markup links, so they are cached as immutable too.

The host versions every `/public/` href it renders (`src/http/static.ts`): the shell's stylesheets,
favicon and logo, and a plugin's `styles`. A file a plugin's own markup links, such as fastjira's
`board-drag.js`, keeps an unversioned URL and is revalidated every five minutes. Offering a way —
`assetHref` documented as a view local, a `ctx.assetHref`, or a `scripts` slot in the shell — adds to
the plugin API, hence a minor. Pick one with the plugin authors' panel, then document it in README →
Reserved view locals.

### 28. Let a plugin add entries to the profile menu through the plugin API.

The profile dropdown stays a dropdown: Sign out is its only entry today, and it will gain more.
`views/partials/shell.ejs` hand-rolls it (AGENTS.md → UI, the dropdown rule), so the entries need a
manifest field that discovery checks, gated like a nav node.

### 2. Rename the admin example plugin to a name that says what it administers.

Candidates: `auth-admin`, `users-groups-admin`. The id is also the mount path, so the compose files,
E2E stacks and README move with it.

### 5. List grants that no installed plugin declares, with a remove action.

`grantDiff` never revokes an undeclared name, and nothing shows one either, so it can't be audited or
cleaned, and reinstalling its plugin silently reactivates access nobody remembers granting.

### 41. Apply a permission save as one Keto call, so it cannot stop part-way.

`applyGrants` writes and deletes one tuple per request and reports a partial save when one fails.
**Check first:** Keto documents `PATCH /admin/relation-tuples`, which should apply a list of inserts
and deletes in one transaction; confirm that against the Keto version `ory/` pins. If so, add the
call to `KetoClient`, which is contract surface (`@plainpages/plugin-api`) and so needs 0.5.0, and the
partial-failure path in the admin example can go.

### 14. Drop a double-clicked duplicate submit, with no client-side JavaScript.

A second identical POST is expected from a non-technical user, and today creates two
users, mints two recovery codes, or registers two OAuth2 clients. It must not break a legitimately
repeatable action. Sketch: a CSS-only affordance so the second click has nothing to hit, plus the
host recognising a duplicate (same session, route and payload within a short window), logging and
dropping it. Open: what identifies "the same submission" (a one-time token minted into each form
beats hashing the payload), the window, where the record lives given the host is stateless, and how
a plugin declares a route repeatable.
