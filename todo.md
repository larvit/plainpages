## Details

### 28. Let a plugin add entries to the profile menu through the plugin API.

The profile dropdown stays a dropdown: Sign out is its only entry today, and it will gain more.
`views/partials/shell.ejs` hand-rolls it (AGENTS.md → UI, the dropdown rule), so the entries need a
manifest field that discovery checks, gated like a nav node.

### 50. Split `handleRequest` into named stages, so each fits the 50-line limit and the stage order is written once.

The hardest place in all eight scoring seats of PR #200: `src/http/app.ts` `handleRequest` is about
165 lines at complexity 43, in `createApp`'s closure, and the order of its stages (headers, static,
canonical host, locale, session, CSRF, contexts, hooks, dispatch) is carried by comments only. Remove
it from `grandfathered` in `src/function-limits.test.ts`. Behaviour must not change; `app-*.test.ts`
is the net. Ships alone (R 5).

### 54. List the `setting` conflict kind in the README's Conflict rules table.

`findConflicts` (`plugin.ts`) emits `kind: "setting"` at `error` level and the table in README →
Conflict rules omits it.

### 2. Rename the admin example plugin to a name that says what it administers.

Candidates: `auth-admin`, `users-groups-admin`. The id is also the mount path, so the compose files,
E2E stacks and README move with it.

### 5. List grants that no installed plugin declares, with a remove action.

`grantDiff` never revokes an undeclared name, and nothing shows one either, so it can't be audited or
cleaned, and reinstalling its plugin silently reactivates access nobody remembers granting.

### 41. Apply a permission save as one Keto call, so it cannot stop part-way.

`applyGrants` writes and deletes one tuple per request and reports a partial save when one fails.
**Check first:** Keto documents `PATCH /admin/relation-tuples`, which should apply a list of inserts
and deletes in one transaction; confirm that against the Keto version `ory/` pins. If so, add the
call to `KetoClient`, which is contract surface (`@plainpages/plugin-api`) and so needs 0.5.0, and the
partial-failure path in the admin example can go.

### 19. Run the documented Docker commands on macOS and fix whatever misbehaves.

Needs a Mac. Two suspects, both from `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`: a macOS `id -g` is `20`, which is
`dialout` inside the noble image, and Docker Desktop remaps bind-mount ownership in its VM.

### 16. Decide whether the single Keto `Resource` namespace splits into per-domain namespaces.

Ory's own examples model `Shift`, `Document` and so on. One global `Resource` bucket is the
project's "no catch-all names" rule applied to namespaces.

### 14. Drop a double-clicked duplicate submit, with no client-side JavaScript.

A second identical POST is expected from a non-technical user, and today creates two
users, mints two recovery codes, or registers two OAuth2 clients. It must not break a legitimately
repeatable action. Sketch: a CSS-only affordance so the second click has nothing to hit, plus the
host recognising a duplicate (same session, route and payload within a short window), logging and
dropping it. Open: what identifies "the same submission" (a one-time token minted into each form
beats hashing the payload), the window, where the record lives given the host is stateless, and how
a plugin declares a route repeatable.
