# Changelog

The release version **is** the plugin contract version (`HOST_API_VERSION`), so a minor is a
contract break: a plugin's `apiVersion` must match the host's `major.minor` or discovery refuses it
at boot. Entries start at 0.3.0.

## 0.3.0

**Breaking.** Set `apiVersion: "0.3.0"`, and name a gate on every route and nav node.

### A session is a gate of its own

`session: true` takes any signed-in user, with no grant to hold — for a page whose data is the
visitor's own (their upstream account, their own tokens), where there is no distinction a permission
could name. An anonymous visitor is bounced to `/login` with the page as `return_to`, exactly as a
permission gate does.

Every route and nav node now names **exactly one** of `public: true`, `session: true` or
`permission: "<resource>:<action>"`, and a gate is spelled `true`:

- Naming **none** is refused. It used to mean public, so a forgotten gate published a page; it now
  fails the boot instead.
- Naming **two** is refused, as before.
- Spelling one anything but `true` is refused — `public: false` and `session: "yes"` both set no gate
  while reading as if they set one.

A section header gates nothing itself, so it takes `public: true` and lets each child decide; the
host still drops a header whose children all filtered out.

`Gate` is exported from `@plainpages/plugin-api`, and `Route` and `NavNode` extend it.

### Filter bars take a multi-select

The `filter-bar` partial gains a `multiselect` control — the same checkboxes on the same query
parameter as `chips`, but behind a button once the list is too long to lay on the bar. Config is
`{ name, legend?, note?, value?, options }`, and the panel says what a capped list left out.

### Fixed

- An identity carrying no email no longer yields a session at all. Login used to mint a JWT for one,
  which every later request then rejected as anonymous — leaving the browser holding a dead cookie
  and no way to tell why.

### Dependencies

- Node 24.20.0.

### Upgrading a plugin

1. Set `apiVersion: "0.3.0"`.
2. Give every route and nav node a gate. Anything that relied on omitting one was public — say
   `public: true` outright.

A page that scopes rows to the signed-in visitor should join on `ctx.user.id`. An email address is
user-changeable and can be reassigned to someone else, who would then inherit the previous holder's
rows. The reference plugin's new `/scheduling/mine` page shows the shape.
