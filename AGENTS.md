# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents and contributors working in this repo. Read `README.md` for
commands and layout.

## Project priorities (do not erode)

1. **Simplicity** — prefer the smallest, most readable solution.
2. **Few dependencies** — runtime deps stay minimal (today `ejs` + `lucide-static`).
   Prefer the Node standard library; justify any new dependency; do not add
   frameworks. The app is
   **stateless — no database**. Auth/identity/OAuth are **Ory sidecar services**
   (Kratos/Keto/Hydra, backed by Postgres), reached over their REST APIs with
   built-in `fetch` — no SDK dependency. New capabilities ship as **plugin
   folders** under `plugins/` that fetch their data from upstream services, not as
   core code. See `README.md` for the architecture.
3. **Strict TypeScript** — `tsconfig.json` is strict (incl. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
   `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`). Keep it that way.

## Docker only — no host tooling

**Everything** (install, typecheck, test, run, build, deploy) goes through Docker /
Docker Compose. **Never run `node`, `npm`, or `tsc` on the host.**

```bash
docker compose up                                # dev server, live reload
docker compose run --rm web npm run typecheck    # strict type check
docker compose run --rm web npm test             # tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d   # production
```

## Rules

- Node 24 runs `.ts` directly (type stripping). Keep all TypeScript **erasable**
  (`erasableSyntaxOnly` is on): no `enum`, `namespace`, parameter properties, or
  decorators. Import local modules with their `.ts` extension.
- **No build step** and no compiled artifacts — do not add a bundler or `tsc` emit.
- Before finishing a change, run the typecheck and tests above; both must pass.
- Tests use the built-in `node --test` runner — no test framework dependency.
- English everywhere. Keep code comments short and information-dense.
- Pin all dependencies and Docker images to exact, human-readable **semantic
  versions** — never ranges (`^`, `~`) and never digests/hashes. npm deps are kept
  exact by `.npmrc` (`save-exact=true`) + `npm ci`; the base image by tag (e.g.
  `node:24.16.0-alpine3.24`).
